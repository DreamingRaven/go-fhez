go-FHEz
=======

GO-FHEz is a go(lang) Fully Homomorphically Encrypted Deep Learning Library (FHEDLL) towards implementing Encrypted Deep Learning as a Service (EDLaaS) in as simple and uniform an interface as possible, with particular consideration to serialization and containerization.

We love other similar projects like lattigo, however we want to support multiple backends (of which lattigo will be one), optimized for various different use cases, and so others can define their own backends as needed like extensions to work with GPUs.

This project is still starting out but we hope to have caught up with our sister project, python-FHEz in due time.
